## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <640px | Single column, stacked images, reduced hero text |
| Tablet | 640–768px | 2-column image grids begin |
| Small Desktop | 768–1024px | Standard layout |
| Desktop | 1024–1280px | Full layout, expanded hero |
| Large Desktop | 1280–1600px | Maximum cinema-width container |

### Touch Targets
- Navigation links at comfortable 16px
- Article cards serve as large touch targets
- Buttons at 14px weight 600 with adequate padding

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Collapses to hamburger on mobile
- **Hero**: Full-bleed maintained, text scales down
- **Image grids**: Multi-column → 2-column → single column
- **Research articles**: Feature-size cards → stacked full-width
- **Trust logos**: Horizontal scroll or reduced grid

### Image Behavior
- Cinematic images scale proportionally
- Full-bleed hero maintained across all sizes
- Image grids reflow to fewer columns
- Video content maintains aspect ratio

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Background Dark: "Runway Black (#000000)"
- Background Light: "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Primary Text Dark: "Charcoal (#404040)"
- Secondary Text: "Cool Slate (#767d88)"
- Muted Text: "Muted Gray (#a7a7a7)"
- Light Border: "Cool Silver (#c9ccd1)"
- Dark Border: "Border Dark (#27272a)"
- Card Surface: "Dark Surface (#1a1a1a)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a cinematic hero section: full-bleed dark background with a cinematic image overlay. Headline at 48px abcNormal weight 400, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -1.2px in white. Minimal text below in Cool Slate (#767d88) at 16px."
- "Design a research article grid: one large card (50% width) with a cinematic image and 24px title, next to two smaller cards stacked. All images with 8px border-radius. Titles in white (dark bg) or Charcoal (#404040, light bg)."
- "Build a section label: 14px abcNormal weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.35px in Cool Slate (#767d88). No border, no background."
- "Create a trust bar: company logos in monochrome, horizontal layout with generous spacing. On dark background with white/gray logo treatments."
- "Design a mission statement section: Runway Black background, white text at 36px abcNormal, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -0.9px. Centered, with generous vertical padding."

### Iteration Guide
1. Visual content first — always include cinematic photography
2. Use abcNormal for everything — specify size and weight, never change the font
3. Keep the interface invisible — no heavy borders, no shadows, no bright colors
4. Use the cool slate grays (#767d88, #7d848e) for secondary text — not warm grays
5. Uppercase labels need letter-spacing (0.35px) — never tight uppercase
6. Dark sections should be truly dark (#000000 or #1a1a1a) — no medium grays as surfaces
